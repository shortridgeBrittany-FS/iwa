        Roger délivrant Angélique (1824) by Louis-Édouard Rioult depicts the
        scene of Orlando Furioso where Ruggiero (French: Roger) rescues Angelica
        (French: Angélique) while riding on a hippogriff.

          <p>
            The word hippogriff, also spelled hippogryph,is derived from the
            Ancient Greek: ἵππος híppos, meaning "horse", and the Italian grifo
            meaning "griffin" (from Latin gryp or gryphus), which denotes
            another mythical creature, with the head of an eagle and body of a
            lion, that is purported to be the father of the hippogriff.The word
            hippogriff was adopted into English shortly before 1615.

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Of the heraldic representations of the hippogriff, Arthur Charles
            Fox-Davies states that hybrid fantastical creatures' depictions are
            "ugly, inartistic, and unnecessary." Their representation leaves one
            with a disappointed feeling of crudity of draughtsmanship. John
            Vinycomb states that the hippogriff is not used in the British
            heraldic tradition.

            According to Vidal, a Spanish historian, this creature was supposed
            to live near Céret, in the County of Roussillon of modern-day
            France, during the Middle Ages. Claw marks were found on a rock near
            Mas Carol. The belief in the existence of the hippogriff, such as
            Ariosto describes, is fiercely attacked in a scientific essay on
            religion in 1862, which argues that such an animal can neither be a
            divine creation, nor truly exist. The Book of Enoch quite clearly
            details how Satan and his fallen angels created various hybrids by
            admixture. The Sphinx is the best known such hybrid. The hippogriff
            is supposed to be a mixture of several animals and the author notes
            that in order to support its weight, the wings would be so heavy
            that flight would be impossible, which proves—without question—that
            it does not exist. In some traditions, the hippogriff is said to be
            the symbol of love, as its parents, the mare and griffin, are
            natural enemies. In other traditions, the hippogriff represents
            Christ's dual nature as both human and divine.

            As with many ancient mythical beasts, a hippogriff named Buckbeak
            (subsequently "Witherwings") features prominently in Harry Potter.
            Peter Dendle says that the portrayal of the treatment of Buckbeak in
            the novels is one example that demonstrates "[t]he emotional need to
            express domination symbolically" as well as being one of the
            episodes that allows Harry to be shown as the "perennial liberator
            of all manner of creatures." Al Roker calls the creation of Buckbeak
            in the film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban "one of the
            most magnificent and realistic creatures in film history." The
            character was used to create the theme for a roller coaster called
            Flight of the Hippogriff at the Florida amusement park The Wizarding
            World of Harry Potter in which the cars are wicker covered and pass
            by a statue of a hippogriff in a nest. Stefano Jossa has
            reconstructed the web of relations of Rowling's hippogriff.
